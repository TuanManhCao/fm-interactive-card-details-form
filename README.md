# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Solution
- Live Site URL: [Interactive Card Details Form](https://fm-interactive-card-details-form-gtzkr488u-tuanmanhcao.vercel.app/)


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom
- Flexbox
- React with Vite

### What I learned
- The important of organizing CSS file so that you're not overwhelm. Although I must say my CSS is a total mess.
- Setting React app without Create React App, using Vite is really nice

### Things I should improve
- Refactor CSS code in a more structure way. Maybe using CubeCSS
- Refactor React code into reusable component (Card and Form separately)
- Use more semantic HTML
